MT32Emu WinMM Application
-------------------------

This win32 application is intended for use with some sort of a MIDI thru driver. It opens MIDI in port and plays MIDI messages via the mt32emu engine.
The main advantage vs. the WinMME driver mt32emu_win32drv is a bit simpler way of debugging.
Other notable feature is that the console version can be compiled and work in Win9x environment.

--
As an example of a MIDI thru, it is proposed to use MIDI Yoke Junction, from http://www.midiox.com/, currently Version 1.75, 09-23-07.
