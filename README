Test programs and parts of MUNT code in development

devel - test programs helping research of filtered square wave generation

DOSBox-mt32-patch - patch for official DOSBox release v.0.74 to add mt32emu MIDI device

mt32emu_win32app - MT32Emu WinMM Application (CLR / .NET)

MIDI_stuff - drivers and utilites which can appear useful for specific MIDI-related tasks

mt32emu_b*_*r - a set of tiny tools that helps with testing BossEmu / BReverb models on arbitrary input (alas, current munt is still inaccurate a bit)

BossEmu - a small class which tries to accurately emulate BOSS reverb gate array HG61H20R36F aka BOS-007 using an image of the reverb ROM.
